Whitelisting from GUI:
----------------------

On Jenkins, you can go to http://jenkins/administrativeMonitor/slaveToMasterAccessControl/ to edit whitelist rules from GUI 
and have them reflected right away in the running instance. It consists of the following three sections:

>>Currently whitelisted commands: See above for what this field means.
>>Currently rejected commands: This section lists unclassified commands that Jenkins has actually rejected. You can check boxes and
submit them to have Jenkins write them into the "currently whitelisted commands" section. Be careful when you do this, though.
>>File Access Fileds:File access request from agents is tested against the rules you specify. Each rule is a tuple that consists of:

allow/deny: if the following two parameters match the current request being considered, an "allow" entry would allow the request to be carried out and a "deny" entry would deny the request to be rejected, regardless of what later rules might say.
operation: the type of the operation requested. The following 6 values exist. You can also list them separating with ',' or use "all" to indicate a match to all operations:
read: read file content or list directory entries
write: write file content
mkdirs: create a new directory
create: create a file in an existing directory
delete: delete a file or directory
stat: read metadata of a file/directory, such as timestamp, length, file access modes.
file path: regular expression that specifies file paths that matches this rule. In addition to the base regexp syntax, it supports the following tokens:
<JENKINS_HOME> can be used as a prefix to match your $JENKINS_HOME directory
<BUILDDIR> can be used as a prefix to match your build record directory, such as /var/lib/jenkins/job/foo/builds/2014-10-17_12-34-56
<BUILDID> matches the timestamp-formatted build IDs, like 2014-10-17_12-34-56.

When submitted, these changes are written back to disk and then re-read right away into Jenkins, including all 
whitelisted-callables.d/.conf and filepath-filters.d/.conf.
