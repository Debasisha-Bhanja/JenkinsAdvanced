Disabling Security:
--------------------
One may accidentally set up a security realm / authorization in such a way that you may no longer be able to reconfigure Jenkins.

When this happens, you can fix this by the following steps:

Stop Jenkins (the easiest way to do this is to stop the servlet container.)

Go to $JENKINS_HOME in the file system and find config.xml file.

Open this file in the editor.

Look for the <useSecurity>true</useSecurity> element in this file.

Replace true with false

Remove the elements authorizationStrategy and securityRealm

Start Jenkins

When Jenkins comes back, it will be in an unsecured mode where everyone gets full access to the system.

If this is still not working, trying renaming or deleting config.xml.
